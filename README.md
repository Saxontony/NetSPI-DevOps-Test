# NetSPI - DevOps Screening Test

Through AWS console, provision an Elastic IP. Assign a tag “Project” with value “NetSPI_EIP” to it. Once it's available, write a Terraform code to implement following infrastructure resources:

1. 
                Created an Elastic IP
                "Tag": 
                    "Key": “Project”
                    "Value": “NetSPI_EIP” 

                Allocated: 54.235.138.246
                Allocation ID: eipalloc-020a23a6c96df045e

-   _S3 bucket with private access permissions_

2. Created via file s3.tf

-   _EFS volume_

3. Created via file efs.tf

-   _An EC2 instance with SSH access_

4. Created via file ec2.tf

-   _All required resources like VPC, Subnets, Security Groups etc. to provision above mentioned resources_

5. created via file network-sg.tf


### These resources should fulfil following requirements:
- _An elastic IP provisioned in the step #1 should be assigned to the provisioned EC2 instance for its public IP_
- _An EFS volume should be mounted on the EC2 instance at /data/test while it boots up_
- _One should be able to write data to mounted EFS volume_
- _One should be able to write data to the provisioned S3 bucket (No AWS credentials should be stored/set on the EC2 instance)_
- _Terraform should display S3 Bucket ID, EFS volume ID, EC2 instance ID, Security Group ID, Subnet ID as part of output generated by Terraform apply command_
