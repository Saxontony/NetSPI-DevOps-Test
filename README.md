# NetSPI - DevOps Screening Test

Through AWS console, provision an Elastic IP. Assign a tag “Project” with value “NetSPI_EIP” to it. Once it's available, write a Terraform code to implement following infrastructure resources:

-   _S3 bucket with private access permissions_
-   _EFS volume_
-   _An EC2 instance with SSH access_
-   _All required resources like VPC, Subnets, Security Groups etc. to provision above mentioned resources_

### These resources should fulfil following requirements:
- _An elastic IP provisioned in the step #1 should be assigned to the provisioned EC2 instance for its public IP_
- _An EFS volume should be mounted on the EC2 instance at /data/test while it boots up_
- _One should be able to write data to mounted EFS volume_
- _One should be able to write data to the provisioned S3 bucket (No AWS credentials should be stored/set on the EC2 instance)_
- _Terraform should display S3 Bucket ID, EFS volume ID, EC2 instance ID, Security Group ID, Subnet ID as part of output generated by Terraform apply command_
